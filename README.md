# tidydata

This is the submission for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, Data Science Specialization on Coursera.org.

The repo includes:
* The run_analysis.R file used for processing the data
* The tidy dataset obtained from processing the data
* The code book of the tidy dataset

The script uses the `dplyr` package and its dependencies.

**Note**: Please put the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder in your working directory for the R script to work properly, i.e. the files in the dataset should be accessed as `./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt`
